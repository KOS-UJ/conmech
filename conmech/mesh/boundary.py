@dataclass
class Boundary:
    """
    Represents a boundary condition for a finite element analysis.

    This class defines a boundary condition with information about the boundary's
    surfaces, node indices (either as a slice or direct SORTED indices), the total
    number of nodes affected by the boundary condition, and an optional node
    condition values.

    Parameters:
    ----------
    surfaces : np.ndarray
        An array containing the surfaces associated with the boundary condition.

    node_indices : Union[slice, np.ndarray]
        Either a slice object specifying a range of node indices or a direct
        sorted array of node indices. These indices define the nodes affected by
        the boundary condition.

    node_count : int
        The total number of nodes affected by the boundary condition.

    node_condition : Optional[np.ndarray], optional
        An optional array specifying the conditions applied to the affected nodes.
        If provided, it should have the same length as `node_count`.

    Examples:
    --------
    To create a Boundary instance for fixing nodes 0 to 9 on a surface:
    ```
    surface = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
    bc = Boundary(surfaces=surface, node_indices=slice(0, 10), node_count=10)
    ```

    To create a Boundary instance for applying a specific condition to nodes:
    ```
    surface = np.array([0, 1, 2])
    indices = np.array([2, 0, 1])
    conditions = np.array([0.0, 1.0, -1.0])
    bc = Boundary(surfaces=surface, node_indices=indices, node_count=3, node_condition=conditions)
    ```
